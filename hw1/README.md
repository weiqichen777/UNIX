## Implement a 'lsof'-like Program  
### Program Arguments  
* `-c REGEX`: a regular expression (REGEX) filter for filtering command line. For example `-c sh` would match `bash`, `zsh`, and `share`.
* `-t TYPE`: a TYPE filter. Valid TYPE includes `REG`, `CHR`, `DIR`, `FIFO`, `SOCK`, and `unknown`. TYPEs other than the listed should be considered invalid. For invalid types, your program has to print out an error message `Invalid TYPE option.` in a single line and terminate your program.
* `-f REGEX`: a regular expression (REGEX) filter for filtering filenames.
