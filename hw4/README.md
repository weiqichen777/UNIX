## Simplified Scriptable Instruction Level Debugger  
In this homework, you have to implement a simple instruction-level debugger that allows a user to debug a program interactively at the assembly instruction level. You can implement the debugger by using the ptrace interface. The commands you have to implement are summarized as follows:  
```  
- break {instruction-address}: add a break point
- cont: continue execution
- delete {break-point-id}: remove a break point
- disasm addr: disassemble instructions in a file or a memory region
- dump addr: dump memory content
- exit: terminate the debugger
- get reg: get a single value from a register
- getregs: show registers
- help: show this message
- list: list break points
- load {path/to/a/program}: load a program
- run: run the program
- vmmap: show memory layout
- set reg val: get a single value to a register
- si: step into instruction
- start: start the program and stop at the first instruction
```
